Leader–country network: edges of the Network view 
The Network view reads a graph projected from the star schema: one Leader node 
per person and one Country node per country, linked by (Leader)-[:REPRESENTS]->(Country) 
and (Leader)-[:VISITED {n_visits, first_visit}]->(Country), built from the BQ5 edge list. 
Like the KPI table, it is derived and can be rebuilt at any time.
